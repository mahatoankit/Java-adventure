# Java Adventure

This repository contains the assignments and learning materials for a **Java programming course** provided by our university. The course progresses week by week, starting from the **basics of Java** and advancing to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

## Course Overview

The course is designed to help students master Java, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually covering more advanced topics. Each week's assignment focuses on building upon the previous week's knowledge.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Introduction to Java
- Basic syntax, data types, variables, and operators.
- Understanding how to write and run a simple Java program.

### Week 2: Control Structures
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`).
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).

### Week 3: Functions and Methods
- Defining and using functions and methods.
- Understanding parameters, return types, and method overloading.

### Week 4: Arrays and Collections
- Working with arrays, both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional.
- Introduction to collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`).

### Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Basics
- Introduction to classes and objects.
- Understanding instance variables and methods.

### Week 6: OOP - Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Understanding inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism.

### Week 7: OOP - Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Understanding abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces.
- Learning how to implement encapsulation to secure data.

### Week 8: Exception Handling
- Understanding try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.
- Handling runtime and checked exceptions.

### Week 9: Advanced OOP Concepts
- Learning about design patterns, interfaces, and lambda expressions.

### Week 10: Final Project
- Applying everything learned in the course to build a complete Java project.

## About the Repository

Each week's assignment and code examples are stored in separate folders and files. The repository provides a clear progression of topics, allowing students to easily track their learning journey.

The repository is meant to serve as a reference for students and a way to showcase their understanding of Java programming and OOP principles.
